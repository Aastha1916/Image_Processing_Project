# Image Processing and Manipulations

This project emerged from the Data Science Training Python Module, serving as an introductory exploration of image processing. Leveraging the powerful NumPy module in Python, it offers a hands-on experience in performing essential image manipulations. 

## Features

The program is menu-based with the following top-level features:
- Load Image
- Edit Image :
    - Horizontal Flip
    - Vertical Flip
    - Invert Colors
    - Convert to Grayscale
    - Convert to B&W
- Save Image
- Quit


## Installation


```bash
  pip install numpy
  pip install matplotlib
  pip install scikit-image
```
    
## Required Libraries

```bash
    from skimage import io
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
```

**NOTE:
* This Program runs for JPG Images only as others may have 4D.
* Keep the input images and Code in the Same Folder.
* You can load only Those Images which are present in the dataset.
